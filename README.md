# covid19charts
Simple visualizations of the regional effects of the pandemic.

There are a few excellent dashboards out there tracking the global effect of Covid-19, but I've still found it hard to understand what exactly is happening with the virus near me, particularly: how fast it is growing, and how my location (Ontario) compares to others. 

So I made a simple page with line-graphs of the number of confirmed cases of the virus, toggle-able between total cases/cases-per-thousand-population, and log/simple y-axis to compare growth rates.

## Future Improvements

I'm planning to expand this page as I find time. If you'd like to help, please reach out through twitter or at the email in my bio. Here's some future expansions

- Bar chart of daily new cases in each area
- Exponential trendlines for each series
- Expanding to cover US states and other regions
- Tracking when lockdowns went into effect & examining the effect on the growth rate
- ...lots of other ideas
